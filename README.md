# Cats Sandbox

This repository contains an empty Scala/Cats project
for use in [Spacecat](https://spacecat.io) training courses.

Licensed [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

## Getting Started

1. To use this repo you'll need to install a Java 11+ compatible JDK.
   We recommend using [Sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) to do this:

   ```bash
   sdk list java
   sdk install java <VERSION_TAKEN_FROM_THE_LIST>
   ```

2. Clone this repository to a directory on your hard drive:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spacecatio/cats-sandbox.git
   cd cats-sandbox
   ```

3. Run the `sbt.sh` script (or use your own locally installed SBT):

   ```bash
   ./sbt.sh
   # Lots of output here. The first run will take a while.
   # You'll see an SBT prompt as follows:
   sbt:sandbox> run
   ```

4. Type `run` at the SBT prompt to run the sample app:

   ```bash
   sbt:sandbox> run
   # Lots of output here. The first run will take a while.
   # You should finally see the following output:
   Hello world!
   ```

5. Type `exit` to quit the SBT prompt when you're done:

   ```bash
   sbt:sandbox> exit
   ```

## Editing Using Visual Studio Code

If you don't have a particular preference for a Scala editor or IDE,
we recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a Linux or macOS terminal.

Ideally you should have the `code` command [set up in your terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_code-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command), in which case:

```bash
cd cats-sandbox
code .
```

If you don't have the command installed, you can open the code from the file menu:

1. Choose _File Menu > New Window_
2. Choose _File Menu > Open Folder..._ and select the repo root folder

We recommend using your terminal to compile and run your code.

You can optionally install the [Metals](https://github.com/scalameta/metals-vscode) plugin
to add IDE-like features for editing Scala in VSCode.
However, please take the time to get this working correctly _before_ your course.

## Editing Using IntelliJ IDEA

If you prefer to edit Scala code using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea):

1. Make sure you have the [Scala plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html) installed
2. Choose _File Menu > Open..._ and select the `build.sbt` file from the repo root folder
3. Choose "Open as Project"

## OpenAI API Keys

To use the Chat GPT client library you'll need to create an OpenAI API key:

1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Click your profile icon inthe top right and select "View API keys"
4. Click "Create new secret key", name the key, and copy the key value
5. Initialise the Chat GPT client in your code as follows:

   ```scala
   import openai.GptService
   
   GptService.resource("secret key goes here")
   ```

6. If you're condiering making your code public,
   **don't commit your secret key to git!**
   Instead, set up an environment variable in your bash/zsh profile
   and use the following code:

   ```scala
   import openai.GptService
   
   GptService.resource(System.getenv("name of environment variable"))
   ```
